## Notes

**Challenges I encountered:**
1. It was a challenge to find the right words and numbers for each of the passwords. It might be silly, but I kept using the wrong div name for the challenge #3. It took me awhile to realize that I was using the wrong div name for the password (the hint helped).
2. I had a challenge trying to implement the search box I have. It seems simple, but it took me awhile to figure out how to sort it. I had to use the internet for help.
